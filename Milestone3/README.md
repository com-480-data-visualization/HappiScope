# Milestone 3 (30th May, 5pm)

**80% of the final grade**

## Final Submission

Our final project submission includes the following components:

### 1. Project Website

**Live Website:** [https://com-480-data-visualization.github.io/HappiScope/](https://com-480-data-visualization.github.io/HappiScope/)

The website features multiple interactive visualizations:

- **Interactive World Map** - Explore happiness metrics across countries and years
- **Country Comparison Tool** - Compare happiness metrics between countries over time
- **Factor Analysis Dashboard** - Analyze correlations between happiness and various socioeconomic factors
- **About & Methodology** - Detailed information about the project approach and data sources

### 2. Screencast

Our 2-minute screencast demonstrates the key features and insights of HappiScope: [Link to Screencast](https://youtu.be/your-video-id)

The screencast:

- Demonstrates the interactive features of our visualizations
- Showcases the main insights users can discover
- Highlights our main contributions to understanding global happiness data
- Presents the project in an engaging and compelling manner

### 3. Process Book

Our process book (max 8 pages) is available [here](./process_book.pdf). It details:

- The journey from concept to final visualization
- Design decisions and their rationales
- Technical challenges and their solutions
- Evolution from initial sketches to final implementation
- Visual design considerations and implementation details
